    <blockquote>
        <p>The website presents an overview of some of the machine learning models and 
        data analytics software tools that I have worked on. It is a work in
        progress and covers applications of machine learning and data analytics 
        in various domains. The website is currently under construction and more 
        projects will be added in the future. Please feel free to explore and get in touch with
        me for any further information!</p>

                stock prices by comparing machine learning models using different
                 evaluation metrics. The data used are obtained 
                from the Yahoo Finance website using the Yahoo Finance API. 
                The project currently has many deep learning and 
                classical machine learning models, such as LSTM using TensorFlow and PyTorch, 
                CNN using TensorFlow, Linear Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, 
                Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Gradient Boosting. More models will be added in the future. </td>
